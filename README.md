# Front
## A web3.js JavaScript generator written in Go

Outputs boilerplate web3.js compatible JavaScript by compiling from solidity or reading smart contract ABI. 

### Install

It's a Go packahge so `go get` and `go install` it. When more complete I'll add binaries.

### Usage 

```front --h```


### Status

- Function generation is fairly well implemented.  
- Async/callbacks in progress.
- Events and constructor all to do.
